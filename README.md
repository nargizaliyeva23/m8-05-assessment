# Assessment | Ship an LLM Chat Micro-Service

## Overview

You will build and ship a small but complete **LLM chat application**: a backend that wraps a model and manages a multi-turn conversation, and a **Streamlit chat UI** a person can actually talk to. It must produce reliable output, be measured with a small eval, and carry at least one real safety mitigation.

This pulls together the whole week — prompting and structured output (Day 2), hosted-vs-local model choice (Day 3), and evaluation and safety (Day 4) — behind one working app you can demo. No fine-tuning, no GPU required.

**Time budget:** Friday class. **Submission deadline:** Sunday 14 Jun 2026, 23:59 local time.

## Learning Goals Verified

This assessment verifies that you can:

- Call an LLM (hosted or local) and manage multi-turn conversation state
- Build a usable chat interface with streaming and history
- Make and justify a model choice with a cost/latency awareness
- Evaluate your app with a small, repeatable eval
- Apply at least one safety mitigation against prompt injection or unsafe output

## What You'll Build

A chat app with a clear purpose — not a generic "talk to an AI" box. Pick a **focused assistant** so your prompt, eval, and guardrail have something concrete to target. Some good options (pick one or propose your own):

- **Study buddy** for one of this course's units — answers questions, quizzes the user
- **Support triage assistant** — chats with a user and classifies/routes their issue
- **Recipe / meal-planner assistant** with dietary constraints
- **Code-explainer** that walks through a pasted snippet
- **Travel or product recommender** for a narrow domain

The domain is yours; the engineering bar is fixed.

## Requirements

### Backend (the micro-service)

- Wraps an LLM — **Gemini (free tier) or a local Ollama model**, your choice (justify it in the README).
- Manages **multi-turn conversation state** (resend history correctly; the API is stateless).
- Uses a clear **system prompt** that defines the assistant's role and constraints.
- Sensible **sampling settings** for the task (and a short note on why).
- Logs or tracks **token usage** (even just printing it) so cost is visible.

### Frontend (Streamlit chat UI)

- A **chat interface** using `st.chat_message` / `st.chat_input`.
- **Conversation history** visible in the UI across turns.
- **Streaming** responses (strongly preferred) so the app feels responsive.
- A small control — e.g. a sidebar to pick model or temperature, or a "clear chat" button.

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

### Evaluation

- A small **eval** (~8–12 cases) with expected answers or a rubric.
- A script or notebook that runs the eval and outputs a **pass-rate table**. LLM-as-judge is fine.

### Safety

- **At least one** concrete safety mitigation, demonstrated. For example: a prompt-injection guardrail (system-prompt hardening + input/output validation), a refusal for out-of-scope requests, or PII/disallowed-content filtering.
- Include **one example** in your README showing an attack or bad input and your app handling it.

## Deliverables

Your submission is a single Git repository with roughly this structure:

```
README.md                  # see below
app.py                     # Streamlit chat UI
llm_service.py             # backend: model calls + conversation state
eval/
  eval_cases.json          # your test cases
  run_eval.py              # runs the eval, prints/writes the pass-rate table
  eval_results.md          # the resulting table + a short verdict
safety/
  README.md                # what mitigation you added and an example of it working
requirements.txt
.env.example               # NEVER commit your real key
```

Adapt the layout if your design differs — but every requirement above must be findable.

## Top-level README

Your repo's root `README.md` must include:

1. **One-paragraph summary** — what the assistant does and who it's for.
2. **How to run it** — setup + the `streamlit run` command.
3. **Model choice** — which model (hosted/local) and **why**, with a sentence on the **cost/latency** trade-off you accepted.
4. **Eval table** — paste the pass-rate table (or link it) and one line on what it shows.
5. **Safety mitigation** — what you added and a short before/after example.
6. **A screenshot or short clip** of the chat UI working.

## Submission

Open a Pull Request to the assessment repository with the full project. Paste the PR link as your deliverable.

**Deadline:** Sunday 14 Jun 2026, 23:59 local time. Late submissions are scored at 70% maximum.

## Grading Rubric

| Area | Weight | What we look for |
|---|---|---|
| Working chat app | 25% | Streamlit chat UI runs, holds multi-turn history, streams responses |
| Backend quality | 20% | Clean model calls, correct conversation state, sensible system prompt & sampling, token usage visible |
| Model choice & cost awareness | 10% | A justified hosted/local choice with a real cost/latency note |
| Evaluation | 20% | A repeatable eval that produces a pass-rate table, with an honest verdict |
| Safety mitigation | 15% | A real, demonstrated guardrail with a before/after example |
| README & polish | 10% | Clear run instructions, screenshot, coherent write-up |

## Tips

- **Start with the smallest thing that runs end-to-end** — a chat box that echoes the model — then add history, streaming, eval, and the guardrail in that order.
- **Reuse your lab code.** Day 2's structured-output and prompts, Day 4's eval harness and guardrail — adapt them, don't rewrite.
- **Pick a narrow assistant.** A focused scope makes your prompt, eval, and safety mitigation all easier and sharper.
- **Make the eval honest.** A small eval that catches one real regression beats a big one full of trivial passes.
- **Never commit your API key.** Use `.env` and `.env.example`.

Good luck — ship something you'd actually demo...
